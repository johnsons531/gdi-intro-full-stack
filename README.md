====================

Slides for Introduction to the Full Stack (Host Your Own Website)

Preparation for the class:

1. Bring your computer.

A tablet is not a substitute for this class. All operating systems will be supported (Mac, Windows, Linux). And if anyone is bold enough to bring a desktop, that works too! We will have power outlets and WiFi available but please remember to bring your own power cord.

2. Setup an Amazon account (https://aws.amazon.com/register).

In order to set up a server through Amazon Web Services (AWS), you need to have an Amazon account (which requires a credit card but no payments). If this will be an issue for you, feel free to email us before class or show up around 6:30-6:45pm on Tuesday and we can help you.

3. Register a domain name (optional).

We will take a little bit of time to review how to set up your website (domain) name. This is not necessary to create a web server. If you want to create a website with an easy-to-remember name, you will have to register the name with an accredited registrar (https://www.icann.org/registrar-reports/accredited-list.html). Don't do this unless you are absolutely certain what you want to call your website as it is not a free service. If you have already registered a domain name, make sure you can log in to the website where you registered for the name and can access the DNS settings.
